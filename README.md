# IMU-data-analysis and feature-engineering

This project is a cooperative project(Dr. Yingcheng Jin and me)

I use IMU data for facial classification(my thesis project) and motion tracking(Dr. Yincheng Jin's thesis), beacuse his paper hasn't been published yet. I won't upload motion tracking traning part without his permission (although I resopnsiable for model training).

Covert raw data into images and find the interval for each sample using Giotto-tda. 

Some explainable AI result can not shown correctly in ipynb code (no image) on the Github, because the JavaScript limitation. So I upload some screen shot for this project.

Extractor and convert the raw data into df
